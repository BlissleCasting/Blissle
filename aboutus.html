    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <div class="story">
    <p>Blissle was born from my heart, during one of the most unforgettable moments of my life ‚Äî the birth of my daughter. Like every new mother, I wanted to preserve the memory of her tiny fingers and delicate toes forever. When she was just two weeks old, I got the chance to create her first hand and foot casts. I was overjoyed ‚Äî the happiness completely overshadowed the pain I was going through from a third-degree tear after delivery.</p>

    <p>Today, when I look at those little casts, memories flood my heart. Her hands were as tiny as a baby bird, her whole being no bigger than a watermelon. These casts are not just plaster; they are frozen moments of time ‚Äî filled with love and emotion.</p>

    <p>At Blissle, I recreate this magic for every customer. To others, it might seem like just another order ‚Äî but for me, it‚Äôs helping a family hold on to a memory forever. I have created casts for babies, for pets nearing the end of their lives, and even for a 7-day-old baby girl who tragically passed away due to a heart condition. That cast became the only touch her grieving parents could hold onto. These experiences deeply moved me and reminded me why Blissle is more than just a business ‚Äî it‚Äôs love, comfort, and remembrance shaped by hand.</p>

    <p>This journey wasn‚Äôt easy. Each creation requires patience, care, and most importantly ‚Äî a heart that feels. Only those who truly understand the value of handmade keepsakes will know the meaning behind every piece we make.</p>

    <p>Blissle is not just my venture. It is part of every family that trusts me with their memories. Each cast I create carries a part of their story ‚Äî and a piece of my soul.</p>

    <p>For us at Blissle, these keepsakes are not products. They are treasures of time, crafted with emotion, for eternity.</p>
